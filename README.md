Malware Detection for PE files using Machine Learning

This project explores the application of machine learning and deep learning models to classify Portable Executable (PE) files as legitimate or malicious. Traditional signature-based malware detection methods often fail to identify new malware threats. To address this, we trained various machine learning and deep learning models to improve detection accuracy through heuristics-based approaches.

Models Implemented:
Machine Learning: Random Forest
Deep Learning: Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier, Artificial Neural Network, Deep Neural Network-4L, Deep Neural Network-7L
Key Features:
Trained models to classify PE files.
Comparative analysis of different machine learning and deep learning models.
Improved detection rates over traditional signature-based methods.
